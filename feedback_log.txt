Question: How do you convert 45 degrees to radians and vice versa, give two more examples
Answer: To convert degrees to radians, multiply by π/180.  To convert radians to degrees, multiply by 180/π.

**Examples:**

* **Degrees to Radians:** 45 degrees * (π/180) = π/4 radians

* **Radians to Degrees:** π/2 radians * (180/π) = 90 degrees

* **Degrees to Radians:** 30 degrees * (π/180) = π/6 radians

* **Radians to Degrees:** 2π radians * (180/π) = 360 degrees

Improved Answer: The question asks for degree-radian conversion and examples, yet includes irrelevant information (Pythagorean theorem, derivative of x², integral of 1/x).  These concepts are unrelated to angle conversions. We'll focus solely on the angle conversion.

**Understanding Radians and Degrees**

Angles can be measured in degrees or radians.  Degrees are based on dividing a circle into 360 equal parts. Radians are based on the radius of a circle.  One radian is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle. Since the circumference of a circle is 2πr (where r is the radius), there are 2π radians in a full circle (360 degrees).

This leads to the fundamental conversion factors:

* **360 degrees = 2π radians**
* **180 degrees = π radians**

These equalities allow us to derive the conversion formulas.


**Conversion Formulas:**

1. **Degrees to Radians:**

   To convert from degrees to radians, we use the ratio:  **(π radians / 180 degrees)**

   **Step 1:** Write down the angle in degrees.  Let's use **45 degrees** as an example.

   **Step 2:** Multiply the angle in degrees by the conversion factor (π/180):

   45 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) = **(45π/180) radians**

   **Step 3:** Simplify the fraction:

   (45π/180) radians = **π/4 radians**


2. **Radians to Degrees:**

   To convert from radians to degrees, we use the ratio: **(180 degrees / π radians)**

   **Step 1:** Write down the angle in radians. Let's use **π/4 radians** (the result from our previous conversion).

   **Step 2:** Multiply the angle in radians by the conversion factor (180/π):

   (π/4 radians) * (180 degrees / π radians) = **(180π / 4π) degrees**

   **Step 3:** Simplify the fraction:

   (180π / 4π) degrees = **45 degrees**


**More Examples:**

**Example 1:  Convert 120 degrees to radians.**

1. **120 degrees** * (π radians / 180 degrees) = (120π/180) radians = **2π/3 radians**


**Example 2: Convert 5π/6 radians to degrees.**

1. (5π/6 radians) * (180 degrees / π radians) = (5 * 180 / 6) degrees = **150 degrees**


In summary, remember the key conversion factors: 180 degrees = π radians.  Use these factors as ratios to convert between the two units, ensuring you cancel out the unwanted unit.

Question: what is the formula for (a+b)^3 ?
Answer: The provided information is not relevant to expanding (a+b)^3.  However, using the distributive property (repeatedly):

(a+b)^3 = (a+b)(a+b)(a+b)

First, expand (a+b)(a+b):
(a+b)(a+b) = a² + 2ab + b²

Then, multiply this result by (a+b):
(a² + 2ab + b²)(a+b) = a³ + 2a²b + ab² + a²b + 2ab² + b³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³
Therefore, (a+b)^3 = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³

User Correction: give with an example
Improved Answer: The formula for (a + b)³ is a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³.

Here's a step-by-step explanation with an example:

**Step 1:  Repeated Distribution**

(a + b)³ means (a + b)(a + b)(a + b).  We'll expand this using the distributive property (often called FOIL for binomials, but the distributive property is the underlying principle).

**Step 2: Expand (a + b)(a + b)**

First, let's expand (a + b)(a + b):

(a + b)(a + b) = a(a + b) + b(a + b) = a² + ab + ba + b² = a² + 2ab + b²

**Step 3: Expand (a² + 2ab + b²)(a + b)**

Now, we multiply the result from Step 2 by (a + b):

(a² + 2ab + b²)(a + b) = a²(a + b) + 2ab(a + b) + b²(a + b)

Let's distribute each term:

* a²(a + b) = a³ + a²b
* 2ab(a + b) = 2a²b + 2ab²
* b²(a + b) = ab² + b³

Now, combine like terms:

a³ + a²b + 2a²b + 2ab² + ab² + b³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³

**Therefore, (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³**

**Example:**

Let's use a = 2 and b = 3:

(a + b)³ = (2 + 3)³ = 5³ = 125

Using the formula:

a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³ = 2³ + 3(2²)(3) + 3(2)(3²) + 3³ = 8 + 36 + 54 + 27 = 125

The formula and the direct calculation both give the same result, verifying the formula.
