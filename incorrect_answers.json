    "model_answer": "LET THE ANGLES OF THE TRIANGLE BE A, B, AND C, WHERE A IS THE LARGEST AND C IS THE SMALLEST.\nWE ARE GIVEN THAT A - C = \u03a0/2.\nSINCE THE ANGLES OF A TRIANGLE SUM TO \u03a0, WE HAVE A + B + C = \u03a0.\nTHE SIDES ARE IN ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION, SO LET THE SIDES BE A-D, A, A+D, WHERE A AND D ARE POSITIVE.\nSINCE THE VERTICES LIE ON A CIRCLE OF RADIUS 1, THE CIRCUMRADIUS R = 1.\nBY THE SINE RULE, WE HAVE A/(SIN A) = B/(SIN B) = C/(SIN C) = 2R = 2.\nTHUS, A = 2SIN A, B = 2SIN B, C = 2SIN C.\nSINCE THE SIDES ARE IN ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION, 2SIN A, 2SIN B, 2SIN C ARE IN ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION.  THIS IMPLIES SIN A, SIN B, SIN C ARE IN ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION.\nHOWEVER, WE ARE GIVEN THAT A - C = \u03a0/2, SO A = C + \u03a0/2.\nSINCE A + B + C = \u03a0, WE HAVE (C + \u03a0/2) + B + C = \u03a0, WHICH MEANS B = \u03a0/2 - 2C.\nWE HAVE SIN A = SIN(C + \u03a0/2) = COS C, SIN B = SIN(\u03a0/2 - 2C) = COS 2C.\nSINCE SIN A, SIN B, SIN C ARE IN ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION, WE HAVE:\n2SIN B = SIN A + SIN C\n2COS 2C = COS C + SIN C\nFROM A + B + C = \u03a0 AND A - C = \u03a0/2, WE HAVE B = \u03a0/2 - 2C.  SINCE B MUST BE POSITIVE, C < \u03a0/4.\n\nTHE INFORMATION GIVEN IS INSUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THE INRADIUS.  MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO SOLVE FOR THE SIDES AND ANGLES PRECISELY."
